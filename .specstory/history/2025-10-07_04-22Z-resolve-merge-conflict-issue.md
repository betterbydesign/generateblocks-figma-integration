# Resolve merge conflict issue (2025-10-07 04:22Z)

Resolve this merge conflict

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I can see there's a merge conflict in the `figma-plugin/manifest.json` file. The conflict is about the `main` field - one version points to `"code.js"` and the other points to `"dist/code.js"`.

Let me resolve this by choosing the correct path based on the project structure and build configuration.


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/scottfoster/git/generateblocks-figma-integration/figma-plugin/webpack.config.js

---

Based on the webpack configuration, I can see that the build output goes to the `dist` directory with the filename `code.js`. Therefore, the correct path should be `"dist/code.js"`. Let me resolve the merge conflict:

Tool use: **search_replace**

Perfect! I've resolved the merge conflict by choosing `"dist/code.js"` as the correct path for the `main` field. This is the right choice because:

1. The webpack configuration shows that the build output goes to the `dist` directory
2. The entry point is `code.ts` which gets compiled to `code.js` in the `dist` folder
3. This matches the standard build process for Figma plugins

The merge conflict has been resolved. You can now commit this change to complete the merge:

```bash
git add figma-plugin/manifest.json
git commit
```

The file now correctly points to `"dist/code.js"` which is where the compiled plugin code will be located after running `npm run build`.
